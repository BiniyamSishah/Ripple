04/17/2020 problem I have are two:
1) I can't establish empty front and back faces. It seems I have a 3D mesh and I am trying to take is as 2D mesh.
solution: 1) extrudeMesh untility after importing the mesh from Ansys
               - This is giving me problem.
          2) Construct a 2D mesh in Ansys and use extrudeMesh utility in OpenFoam
               -  Not done yet
          2) Constract a 2d Mesh and extude on Ansys Mesher
               -  Not done yet
