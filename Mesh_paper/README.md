In all meshes, no. of vertical cells is 150
               no. of horizontal cells is 100
               aspect ration/bias is 20
               allowable max. cell size is 0.005 m
               height of bottom-most cell is 0.00025 m

This are very good meshs. All quality checks had been made and the case files on openFoam have been created. Since in a previous grid independence test, the mesh property outlined above is shown to work well for the smallest and largesrt amplituide of freestream displacments, thier is no need to perform any mesh quality tests.  

It would be a good stratey to check suffcients points are present in the viscous sublayer layer for resolving the flow.
