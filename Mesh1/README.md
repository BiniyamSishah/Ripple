ripple1.msh: inverted(cyclic in z direction) mesh with global cell size =0.005 and simplegrading 30, bottom cell=0.0001, 100 vertical lines.
         Only a tolerance of 10 worked below thast createPatch gives bad mesh. 
ripple2.msh: like ripple1.msh but cyclic in x direction. tolerance of 10 doesn't work.
ripple3.msh : like ripple2.msh but a reduced resolution mesh. done to test openFOAM.
